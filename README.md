# Butterfly Whispers 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: illuminati

### Team Members
- Member 1: Arya P Sunil-GEC thrissur
- Member 2: Chrisbel Muthuplackal-GEC thrissur

### Hosted Project Link
https://butterfly-whispers.onrender.com

### Project Description
Butterfly Whispers is a digital journal web application built using Flask and SQLite.
It allows users to securely log in, create private journal entries with PIN protection, upload images, and manage past entries with edit and delete options.
The platform combines functionality with a soft aesthetic design to create a personalized and secure journaling experience.

### The Problem statement
Many people want to maintain a personal journal, but traditional methods do not ensure privacy and are not easily accessible. Existing digital tools often lack structured reflection sections and simple security features. Therefore, there is a need for a secure and user-friendly digital journaling platform that allows users to store, manage, and protect their personal thoughts.
